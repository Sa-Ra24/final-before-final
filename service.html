                    <h4>What is Firewall?</h4>
                    <p>A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, and helps prevent unauthorized access to or from private networks. Firewalls can be implemented in various forms, including hardware appliances, software applications, or a combination of both. They are essential components of network security, helping to protect against cyber threats like hackers, malware, and unauthorized access.</p>

                    <h3>SIEM Solution - Splunk</h3>
                    <p>Splunk is a big data platform that simplifies the task of collecting and managing massive volumes of machine-generated data and searching for information within it. It provides real-time log ingestion, alerting against abnormal activities, 24/7 monitoring, and more.</p>
                    <p>It correlates, captures, and indexes real-time data, creating alerts, dashboards, and visualizations for operational intelligence.</p>
                    <h4>What is SIEM solution?</h4>
                    <p>SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management system. It is a tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place, and performs correlation on them.</p>
                    <p>Importance of SIEM: It not only takes logs from various sources in real-time but also provides the ability to correlate between events, search through the logs, investigate incidents, and respond promptly.</p>
                    <h4>Example for SIEM solution: Splunk</h4>
                    <p>Splunk is an advanced and scalable form of software that indexes and searches for log files within a system and analyzes data for operational intelligence. The software is responsible for splunking data, which means it correlates, captures, and indexes real-time data, from which it creates alerts, dashboards, graphs, reports, and visualizations. This helps organizations recognize common data patterns, diagnose potential problems, apply intelligence to business operations, and produce metrics.

                    <h3>Snort IDS/IPS</h3>
                    <p>Snort is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It performs live traffic analysis, attack and probe detection, packet logging, and real-time alerting.</p>
                    <p>It can be configured as a packet sniffer, packet logger, or a full-blown network intrusion prevention system.</p>
                    <h4>IPS vs IDS</h4>
                    <p>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a passive monitoring solution for detecting possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It generates alerts for each suspicious event but does not take automatic action to block or prevent the detected threats.</p>
                    <p>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), on the other hand, actively protects by preventing possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It monitors network traffic or system logs and takes immediate action to block the malicious activity when detected.</p>
                    <p>IPS provides a proactive layer of defense by actively stopping potential threats before they can cause harm, while IDS identifies threats but requires user intervention to stop them.</p>
                    <h4>What is Snort?</h4>
                    <p>Snort is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It can be used as a packet sniffer, packet logger, or a full-blown network intrusion prevention system.</p>
                    <p>Capabilities of Snort include live traffic analysis, attack and probe detection, packet logging, protocol analysis, real-time alerting, and cross-platform support (Linux & Windows).</p>
                    <p>More information about Snort can be found on their <a href="https://www.snort.org/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
